                    <h1>Light Flight</h1>
                    <p>Light Flight is what I'm currently working on. It's a 3D flight sim with a twist: As you fly, your plane leaves behind a Tron-esque trail of light. This adds a tactical layer to aerial dogfighting, as you can restrict your opponent's manuevers and options by walling them in with your trail. With multiple ships, modes, levels,  and split-screen and online play, Light Flight is easily my most ambitious game to date. Created for an independent study using Unity, advised by Tao Ju.</p>

                    <h1>Perspectivus</h1>
                    <p>Perspectivus is an isometric puzzle game about changing your perspective. By rotating each diorama-like level between four angles, new paths appear to form -- and if two platforms look connected, then you can interact with them as if they are connected. Perspectivus sprawls across 4 unique worlds, each with their own puzzle mechanics. This was my first large-scale game, with a run time of several hours. Created for CSE450A using Unity.</p>

                    <h1>Fae</h1>
                    <p>Fae is an online 2D cooperative puzzle-platformer. One player has control of Laura with the arrow keys, who has all the faculties of a normal 2D, side-scrolling hero -- moving, jumping, and so on. The other player, though, instead has mouse-control of a fairy with the power to manipulate the elements -- redirecting water and fire, in the two-level demo. Created for the Global Game Jam using Phaser.</p>

                    <h1>Buoyancy</h1>
                    <p>Buoyancy is an iPhone rhythm game where the player must quickly tap rings emanating from the center of the screen as they reach the edges of larger rings of the same color. Timing, planning, and sheer reflexes are all keys to success in Buoyancy. Created for CSE436 using XCode.</p>

                    <h1>Dueling Daikaiju</h1>
                    <p>Dueling Daikaiju is an iPad implementation of the classic game of Battleship, in which two players place their ships on a grid, then attempt to guess the positions of the other player's ships. Dueling Daikaiju adds to this core gameplay art in the Ukiyo-e woodblock style, in particular Hokusai's "The Great Wave off Kanagawa." One-player vs. AI and two-player pass-and-play variants are supported. Created for CSE436 using XCode.</p>

                    <p>Mondrian-Tac-Toe is another iOS implementation of a classic game -- in this case, Tic-Tac-Toe. The game has been faithfully ported and given a style reminiscent of the works of one of my favorite artists, Piet Mondrian. A simple game, but a pretty one. Created for CSE436 using XCode.</p>

                    <p>Spring Escape is an infinite climber starring a cat with a jetpack that's found himself trapped in an abandoned spring factory. Unlike most infinite- games, rather than controlling the protagonist, you control the environment. Drop springs and blow wind as needed to keep the cat ascending and try to make it as high as you can. Created for the St. Louis ScatterJam using XCode.</p>

                    <p>Directory Quest is a text-based game that simulates a Unix-based command line. A heavily narrative-driven game, the player takes on the role of a new hire at an extremely suspicious company. By digging through the company's internal file systems, solving puzzzles, finding passwords, and piecing together clues, the mystery gradually unravels. Created at GameJam STL.</p>

                    <h1>Bit Breaker</h1>
                    <p>Bit Breaker is an homage to 8-bit. It's an implementation of the classic game of Breakout, where you have a paddle and a ball and are tasked with destroying every brick on screen with the ball while using the paddle to prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen. In Bit Breaker, though, the bricks of each level are the pixels of various 8-bit sprites, so the nostalgia factor is strong. This was my first game, so the nostalgia factor is there for me, too.

                    <h1>Dead Drop</h1>
                    <p>Dead Drop is a traditional-media card game set in the Old West. Players have to particpate in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma scenarios with their opponents, betting resources and choosing whether to ally with or betray their partners. Each round also adds new and varied rules to the game, leading to an unpredictable game that never plays out the same way twice. Expect lots of double-crossing.</p>
