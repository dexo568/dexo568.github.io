                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>My name is, as you may have surmised, Declan McKelvey-Hembree. Originally from Los Angeles, I am currently in my senior year studying Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. <br>
                        <br>
                        When I'm not doing coursework, I'm usually making (or playing) video games. There's something fascinating about games, and indeed games have captivated us since almost the dawn of civilization. There is something intrisic about humanity's relationship to games -- leave someone alone in a room with a knot, and the odds are good that they'll try to untie it. While I can't pretend to wholly understand it, designing games that can tap into that relationship is a compelling experience. Philosophy aside, I think that games at their best can be true art, and although I haven't yet made anything approaching that term, I one day hope to. <br>
                        <br>
                        I also spend a great deal of time teaching computer science, as teaching in general is something that I find incredibly fulfilling. I especially enjoy teaching introductory computer-science courses -- I love seeing the "Aha!" moment in students' eyes when they understand some programming principle for the first time, and that occurs especially frequently in introductory classes.<br>
                        <br>
                        Games that I enjoy include <a href="http://virtueslastreward.com/"><u>Virtue's Last Reward</u></a>, <a href="http://lifeisstrange.com/index.php"><u>Life is Strange</u></a>, <a href="http://freebirdgames.com/to_the_moon/"><u>To The Moon</u></a>, <a href="http://www.weareminority.com/papo-yo/"><u>Papo y Yo</u></a>, <a href="http://www.brothersthegame.com/"><u>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</u></a>, and <a href="http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/"><u>Starcraft</u></a> (not that you were wondering).<br>
                        <br>
                        Of course, this page would be remiss without my <a href="DeclanMcKelveyHembreeResume.pdf"><u>resume</u></a> and a way to <a href="mailto:djmckelv@wustl.edu"><u>contact me</u></a>.
