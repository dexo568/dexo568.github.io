                    Aside from my games, I've programmed a variety of other things, some of which you can see on my <a href="https://github.com/dexo568"><u>Github repository</u></a> (including the source code for this very website!). They comprise a mixture of work for employers, labs that are a part of the curriculm at Washington University in St. Louis, where I am currently studying to receive my BS in Computer Science, and personal projects. <br>
                    <br>
                    Most recently, I worked at <a href="https://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/"><u>Less Annoying Software</u></a> as both a web developer and as customer support. Interacting with end-users was a first-time experience for me, and it was definitely an eye-opening one. Customers used the site in a way that was profoundly different than how I used it, and this revelation made me reconsider the way I tend to design UIs. I also spent a lot of time working on APIs, in particular integration with <a href="https://zapier.com/"><u>Zapier</u></a>. This also required some thought on user-facing design, as the API endpoint data formed the basis of the Zapier UI. Previously, I had mostly worked on back-end or internal tools, so I enjoyed the opportunity to grow and learn more about front-end design.<br>
                    <br>
                    Probably the most interesting project I've ever worked on is the NASA <a href="https://www.sofia.usra.edu/index.html"><u>SOFIA project</u>, which is an airborne observatory aboard a modified Boeing 747. During my time working on SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy), I wrote the interface to one of the SOFIA instruments, the Echelon-Cross-Echelle Spectrograph (EXES), and also got to spend time working with the spectograph's optical systems. Although I can't pretend to completely understand the science behind ecehlon-echelle spectroscopy, as I'm a computer scientist, not a physicist, it was certainly a fascinating project and I feel lucky to have been able to contribute the interface. You can check out an interesting overview video of the project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rdKZJUs7bU"><u>here.</u></a><br>
                    <br>
                    As a programmer, I am well-versed in Java and C#, and comfortable with C, C++, Python, and PHP (along with the associated web development languages -- HTML, CSS, etc.). I even know some VHDL!<br>
                    <br>
                    I favor <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2"><u>Sublime Text 2</u></a> as my editor of choice, and <a href="https://eclipse.org/"><u>Eclipse</u></a> and <a href="https://netbeans.org/"><u>Netbeans</u></a> for larger projects that require integrated development environments.<br>
                    <br>
